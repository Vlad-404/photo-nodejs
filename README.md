Welcome to my photos portfolio page! Here you will be able to see some of my work I gathered over time and during my travels. I welcome you to make your self comfortable, enjoy the images and if you like some of them, why not consider a purchase?

This project is a rework of an older project I did with Django with the same name, but this time in Node.js. I will be using the MEAN stack(MongoDB, Express, Angula and Node.js) for this project and it will be a challenge for me. I will also add some new technologies to this project, such as TypeScript, Tailwind and I will also change the database from PostgresSQL to MongoDB.

I'm hoping you will enjoy this website as I did creating it.
